## Third-Party Assets

### Temporary Sound Effects

This project currently includes temporary sound effects generated using [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/), a tool based on Sfxr by DrPetter. These sounds are included for development and testing only and are intended to be replaced with original audio before final release.

Bfxr and Sfxr sounds are generally considered public domain (CC0), but please verify with the toolâ€™s documentation or your use case. Final release will not contain any third-party sound assets.
