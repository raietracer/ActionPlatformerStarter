# BETA DISCLAIMER

Demo live on the asset page [Itch.io](https://mymstake.itch.io/actionplatformerstarter))!

The modularity of the project has been maintained through a plethora of exposed properties in the character controller's inspector. Once you have a local copy of the `action_platformer` directory, you should have everything necessary to link functionality into a different project â€” however, this hasn't yet been properly prepared or implemented and remains theoretical for now.

# Overview

A versatile, modular, feature-rich starting point for 3D platforming games built in Godot 4.4.

This project aims to help both new and experienced Godot users get started building a 3D action game. At the very least, it provides a stable movement script with a wide array of tuning options and easy potential for swapping out player graphics and playtesting levels quickly.

My goal upon completion is for the entire set of scenes, resources, and scripts to live in one neat folder, ready to drag and drop into your own project. Alternatively, it will also serve as a clean and functional starter project for those building from scratch.

Major credit to [Majikayo Games](https://www.youtube.com/@MajikayoGames) who's tutorial series was invaluable for getting the source engine air control feel.  There are more mechanics from the same tutorial series being implemented such as the system for prop physics, stair and ladder handling, as well as the core for player picked interaction via SpringArm3D nodes using sphere shapes to check camera focus.
